          <h2>Why Milan?</h2>
          <h3>Secrets of Innovation and Heritage</h3>
          <p>
            While Milan is often celebrated for fashion and finance, one of its
            best-kept secrets lies underground: the city hosts a vast network of
            hidden canals, or *navigli*, once engineered by Leonardo da Vinci
            himself. These waterways, now mostly covered or repurposed, were
            instrumental in transporting marble for the construction of the
            Duomo and played a major role in Milan's industrial growth. Today,
            remnants of this canal system can still be explored in the Navigli
            district, where ancient infrastructure quietly supports one of the
            city's most vibrant nightlife and art scenes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another little-known fact is Milan's role in contemporary urban
            agriculture. Beneath its modern skyline, the city is nurturing a
            green revolution with rooftop farms, vertical gardens, and
            innovative sustainability projects. Initiatives like the *Bosco
            Verticale* (Vertical Forest) — two residential towers covered in
            over 20,000 plants — are not just visually stunning, but also help
            reduce pollution and regulate temperature. These hidden layers of
            Milan reveal a city not just rich in history, but also deeply
            invested in shaping the future of urban living.

            Hi! My name is Jesthel and I’ve been living in Milan for several

            will be useful to anyone planning a trip to Milan—or even just
            dreaming about it from afar.
